## Reading Reference Docs

Reference documentation is:

- **Information-oriented** - Focuses on describing *what exists*
- **Accurate** - Every detail matters, kept up-to-date with code
- **Complete** - Covers all features, even obscure ones
- **Structured** - Organized for lookup, not linear reading

Don't read reference docs cover-to-cover. Instead:

1. **Look up** what you need when you need it
2. **Verify** assumptions about how things work
3. **Discover** features you didn't know existed
4. **Confirm** exact method signatures or parameter types

## Need Context?

Reference docs tell you *what* and *how*, but not *why*:

- For **why** something works a certain way → See [Explanation](../explanation/)
- For **how to use** something in practice → See [How-To Guides](../how-to-guides/)
- For **learning** from scratch → See [Tutorials](../tutorials/)
